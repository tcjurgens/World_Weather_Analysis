# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project

There are 3 different deliverables submitted in this project

The first, located in the Weather_Database subfolder, contains weather data for 2000 randomly generated latitudes and longitudes-- I have created a new DataFrame from this data and exported it as a CSV file 

The second, located in the Vacation_Search subfolder, is a script which filters possible vacation locations based on customer temperature preferences. Submitted in the folder is the Vacation_Search.ipynb file, the WeatherPy_vacation.csv file, and the WeatherPy_vacation_map.png image

The last deliverable, located in the Vacation_Itinerary subfolder, is a travel itenary map that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. These possible travel destinations were based on the arbritrary temperature values used in the second deliverable. Within the Vacation_Itinerary folder are the Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb file, the WeatherPy_travel_map.png image, and the WeatherPy_travel_map_markers.png image.
